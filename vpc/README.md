------- VPC

All values ​​can be passed by reference.

The variables.tf file has default values ​​if no value is passed in Terraform execution. I tried to make no resource created abstractly, 
also added the diagram image to make it easier to visualize the infrastructure created.

The backend.tf and main.tf files need to be fill with you own configurations.

Any suggestion and improvement is welcome.
